\033[1mUsage: dtetool input_file [-d diff_file] [-o output_file] [-p]\033[0m
Add, remove, or modify device tree properties and entries.
  -d  diff file to apply to input file
  -o  device tree output file
  -p  print device tree to console in a readable format
      print input file if no output file specified

  dtetool DeviceTree.im4p -p
  dtetool DeviceTree.im4p -d dtediff -o DeviceTree.im4p.out

\033[1mDIFF FORMAT\033[0m

Add entries by specifying only the full node path of the entry and nothing else. Add or modify properties by specifying the full node path of the property and a length. No value is required if the length is zero. If a value is specified, a data format specifier is required. Valid data format specifiers are d for decimal, h for hexadecimal, and s for strings. For binary data, use b as the format specifier and a valid filename as the value. Remove properties and entries by prepending the diff with - (dash).

\033[1mPROPERTY MASK\033[0m

If a diff is preceded with & (ampersand), all entries containing the specified property that do NOT match the specified value will be removed from the tree. If a diff is preceded with ~ (tilde), all entries containing the specified property that match the specified value will be removed from the tree. The first field is treated as a single property name and not a full path. A property mask diff must specify a value and type. Multiple masks may be defined.
